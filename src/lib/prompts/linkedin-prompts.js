LEAD GENERATION OPTIMIZATION:
Pattern Interrupt Requirements:
- First 2 lines must hook with unexpected insight or contrarian view
- Use numbers/statistics in opening when possible
- Create curiosity gap that demands completion

Value Exchange Framework:
- Provide 3-5 actionable tips upfront (no gatekeeping)
- Tease additional value behind micro-commitment
- Position offer as exclusive or time-limited
- Use "Comment + DM" strategy for higher engagement

Trust Signals to Include:
- Specific numbers/metrics from your experience
- Client results or testimonials (anonymized)
- Industry credentials or recognition
- "Helped X+ professionals achieve Y"

Psychological Triggers:
- FOMO: Limited spots/time offers
- Social Proof: Others taking action
- Authority: Expertise demonstration
- Reciprocity: Give value first
- Commitment: Small yes leads to bigger yes

CTA Optimization:
- Single, clear action (not multiple options)
- Reduce friction: "Type 'YES'" vs "Fill out form"
- Create urgency without desperation
- Use emoji markers for visual prominence
- Place CTA after value delivery, not before` : ''}

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Primary: ${validatedParams.audience}
- Vocabulary level: ${audienceGuide.vocabulary}
- Content focus: ${audienceGuide.focus}
- Engagement style: ${audienceGuide.engagementStyle}
- Optimal posting time: ${audienceGuide.timing}

LINKEDIN FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
Structure: ${purposeGuide.structure}
${characterGuidance}
${visualGuidance}

CONTENT STRATEGY:
- Key emphasis: ${purposeGuide.emphasis}
- Engagement focus: ${purposeGuide.engagementFocus}
${validatedParams.keywords.length ? `- Include these keywords naturally: ${validatedParams.keywords.join(', ')}` : ''}
${validatedParams.url ? `- Reference this URL if relevant: ${validatedParams.url}` : ''}

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use credible sources for any claims or statistics
- Avoid false personal experience claims
- Base insights on research, studies, or verifiable data
- Never claim fake authority or unverifiable credentials
- Focus on valuable insights, not personal credentials

LINKEDIN OPTIMIZATION:
- Start with scroll-stopping hook (first 1-2 lines)
- Use line breaks every 2-3 sentences for mobile readability
- Include strategic ‚Üí bullets or visual elements
- Add professional emojis for emphasis (not decoration)
- Build toward clear professional takeaway
