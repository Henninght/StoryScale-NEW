Productivity isn't about working MORE hours. It's about working the RIGHT hours.

My biggest revelation? My peak performance happens at 6 AM, not 9 AM. Without a commute, I could actually use those golden hours for deep work instead of sitting in traffic.

Here's what changed everything:
• Time-blocking my calendar around energy levels, not arbitrary office hours
• Taking walking meetings in my neighborhood (goodbye, conference room!)
• Actually using my lunch break to recharge (novel concept, right?)

The result? I'm delivering better work in fewer hours, and my team notices the difference.

The future of work isn't about WHERE we work. It's about designing work around human performance, not industrial-age schedules.

What productivity myth did remote work shatter for you? 🤔
