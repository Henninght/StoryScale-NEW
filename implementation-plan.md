## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (Updated Architecture)

### Function Composition Over Agent Orchestration
```python
# New approach - Function composition:
async def process_request(request: ContentRequest) -> ContentResponse:
    # Smart routing
    route = await intelligent_gateway.classify_and_route(request)
    
    if route.cached:
        return route.cached_response
    
    # Parallel function execution
    tasks = []
    if route.needs_research:
        tasks.append(research_function(request))
    
    tasks.append(generate_function(request))
    
    # Compose results
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    # Apply optimizations and validation
    content = await compose_and_optimize(results, request)
    quality_score = await validate_function(content)
    
    if quality_score < 0.7:
        # Trigger regeneration with feedback
        content = await regenerate_with_feedback(request, quality_score)
    
    return ContentResponse(content=content, metadata=build_metadata(results))
```

### Multi-Layer Caching Strategy
```yaml
caching_strategy:
  L1_memory: 
    purpose: "Request deduplication"
    ttl: "5 minutes"
    hit_rate_target: "15%"
  
  L2_redis:
    purpose: "Research results & patterns" 
    ttl: "24 hours"
    hit_rate_target: "25%"
    
  L3_cdn:
    purpose: "Common templates & responses"
    ttl: "7 days" 
    hit_rate_target: "10%"
    
total_cache_hit_rate: "50% (vs 45% original target)"
```

## Critical Design Requirements (MUST MATCH)

### Colors (Use exact hex values)
- Orange brand: #E85D2F (Tools button, brand elements)
- Blue CTAs: #5B6FED (Primary buttons, active states)
- Purple accent: #8B5CF6 (Enhance button, special actions)
- Green success: #10B981 (Generate Post button, success states)
- Gray backgrounds: #F9FAFB (Sidebar, card backgrounds)

### Layout Dimensions
- Sidebar: Exactly 240px width
- Edit tool sidebar: Exactly 380px width
- Card padding: 24px
- Border radius: 8px for cards, 6px for inputs

### UI Components Must Match Screenshots
- Always check `/storyscale-v3/design-reference/` before implementing any UI
- Step indicators must use blue (#5B6FED) for active state
- Metric cards need white background with shadow: `0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)`
