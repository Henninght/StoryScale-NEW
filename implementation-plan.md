# 🚀 StoryScale Implementation Plan for Claude Code (Updated August 2025)

## Executive Summary
StoryScale is an AI-powered content studio for creating professional LinkedIn posts, blogs, and marketing copy in under 15 seconds. The project uses Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, and multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI + Anthropic).

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Updated Architecture** 
Based on expert system-architect, backend-engineer, and product-manager analysis, this implementation plan now reflects the **new 3-layer function-based architecture** instead of the original 6-agent orchestration system for better performance (4-6s vs 15-30s) and maintainability.

**Important Files to Reference:**
- **UPDATED** Architecture: `/storyscale-v3/architecture.md` (now shows 3-layer system)
- **UPDATED** AI Processing: `/storyscale-v3/agents.md` (now shows function composition)  
- Database Schema: `/storyscale-v3/database.md`
- API Specs: `/storyscale-v3/api.md`
- Design Screenshots: `/storyscale-v3/design-reference/`
- Development Guide: `/storyscale-v3/claude.md`

async def process_request(request: ContentRequest) -> ContentResponse:
    # Smart routing
    route = await intelligent_gateway.classify_and_route(request)
    
    if route.cached:
        return route.cached_response
    
    # Parallel function execution
    tasks = []
    if route.needs_research:
        tasks.append(research_function(request))
    
    tasks.append(generate_function(request))
    
    # Compose results
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    # Apply optimizations and validation
    content = await compose_and_optimize(results, request)
    quality_score = await validate_function(content)
    
    if quality_score < 0.7:
        # Trigger regeneration with feedback
        content = await regenerate_with_feedback(request, quality_score)
    
    return ContentResponse(content=content, metadata=build_metadata(results))
```

### Multi-Layer Caching Strategy
```yaml
caching_strategy:
  L1_memory: 
    purpose: "Request deduplication"
    ttl: "5 minutes"
    hit_rate_target: "15%"
  
  L2_redis:
    purpose: "Research results & patterns" 
    ttl: "24 hours"
    hit_rate_target: "25%"
    
  L3_cdn:
    purpose: "Common templates & responses"

## 🞯 Key Implementation Priorities (UPDATED)

1. **🚀 Speed-First Architecture**: Target <1s for 50% requests, 4-6s for complex (vs 15-30s) ✅
2. **💰 Cost Optimization**: 60% cost reduction through intelligent routing and caching ✅
3. **🧠 Quality Excellence**: 85% first-generation acceptance through learning systems 🚧
4. **📦 Function Composition**: Stateless, scalable functions over agent orchestration ✅
5. **📊 Progressive Rollout**: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% with fallbacks and monitoring 🚧

## Critical Design Requirements (MUST MATCH)

### Colors (Use exact hex values)
- Orange brand: #E85D2F (Tools button, brand elements)
- Blue CTAs: #5B6FED (Primary buttons, active states)
- Purple accent: #8B5CF6 (Enhance button, special actions)
- Green success: #10B981 (Generate Post button, success states)
- Gray backgrounds: #F9FAFB (Sidebar, card backgrounds)

### Layout Dimensions
- Sidebar: Exactly 240px width
- Edit tool sidebar: Exactly 380px width
- Card padding: 24px
- Border radius: 8px for cards, 6px for inputs

### UI Components Must Match Screenshots
- Always check `/storyscale-v3/design-reference/` before implementing any UI
- Step indicators must use blue (#5B6FED) for active state
- Metric cards need white background with shadow: `0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)`
- Data tables require hover states and status pills

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Rate Limits**: Use Redis caching with 1-hour TTL for research, 10-min for suggestions
- **Cost Control**: Track usage in `quota_usage` field, implement hard limits per tier
- **Data Privacy**: RLS policies from day one, GDPR-compliant data handling
- **Performance**: Target <15s generation, <2s page load, <500ms API response
- **Fallbacks**: OpenAI → Anthropic fallback chain, skip research on provider failure

## Success Metrics (Updated Targets)

### Performance Targets (Improved)
- ✅ **Simple requests**: <1s (50% cached responses)
- ✅ **Complex requests**: 4-6s (vs 15-30s competitors) 
- ✅ **Research requests**: 6-10s (vs 20-35s current)
- ✅ **Cache hit rate**: 50% across 3 cache layers
- ✅ **Cost per document**: $0.02 (60% reduction)

### Quality Targets
- ✅ **First-generation acceptance**: 85% (vs 60% industry)
- ✅ **User revision requests**: <15% (90% reduction)
- ✅ **Content quality score**: >0.7 threshold (English & Norwegian)
- ✅ **Pattern learning accuracy**: >75%
- ✅ **🇳🇴 Norwegian content quality**: >0.7 threshold with cultural appropriateness

### Business Targets  
- ✅ **User retention**: 80% after first content creation
- ✅ **Error rate**: <2% in production
- ✅ **System uptime**: 99.9% for all services
- ✅ **Break-even time**: 7.6 months (30% faster ROI)

## Quick Start for Claude Code

### Step 1: Initialize Project
```bash
# Create project with exact specifications
npx create-next-app@14 storyscale --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
cd storyscale

# Install all dependencies at once
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs openai anthropic-ai/sdk stripe @stripe/stripe-js @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-switch clsx tailwind-merge swr redis

# Install dev dependencies
npm install -D @types/node jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom playwright @next/bundle-analyzer
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with all required keys:
```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# AI Providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# Research
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=
TAVILY_API_KEY=

# Payments
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Redis (for caching)
REDIS_URL=
```

### Step 3: Database Setup
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com and create new project
2. Copy ALL SQL from `/storyscale-v3/database.md` lines 82-633
3. Execute in Supabase SQL editor
4. Enable Google OAuth in Authentication settings

### Step 4: Start Building
Follow the phases above in order, checking off each task as completed.

## Common Claude Code Commands

```bash
# When implementing UI components
# First check the design reference:
ls /storyscale-v3/design-reference/dashboard/
ls /storyscale-v3/design-reference/wizard/

# When implementing agents
# Copy exact code from agents.md:
cat /storyscale-v3/agents.md | head -n 196  # For InputAgent

# When setting up API routes
# Reference the exact specifications:
cat /storyscale-v3/api.md | head -n 156  # For document endpoints

# For database queries
# Use the exact schema:
cat /storyscale-v3/database.md | head -n 167  # For documents table
```

## 🤖 When to Use Sub-Agents

Use the Task tool to launch specialized agents for complex tasks:

**For Strategic Decisions:**
```bash
# Use product-manager for feature prioritization
Task with product-manager: "Should we build image generator or blog writer first?"

# Use system-architect for architectural decisions
Task with system-architect: "Design scalable multi-tenant architecture"
```

**For Implementation:**
```bash
# Use frontend-architect for React/UI architecture
Task with frontend-architect: "Optimize wizard component hierarchy and performance"

# Use backend-engineer for API/database work
Task with backend-engineer: "Design rate limiting for AI provider calls"
```

**For Issues & Operations:**
```bash
# Use debug-investigator for systematic debugging
Task with debug-investigator: "Agent pipeline timeout on step 3 - investigate"

# Use devops-config-architect for deployment/infrastructure
Task with devops-config-architect: "Set up production monitoring and alerting"

# Use security-analyst for security reviews
Task with security-analyst: "Audit guest session implementation for vulnerabilities"
```
